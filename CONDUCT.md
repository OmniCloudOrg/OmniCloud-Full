# OmniCloud Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the OmniCloud community pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. We recognize that diversity is our strength, and we strive to create an environment where everyone can participate, contribute, and feel valued.

## Our Standards

The OmniCloud community is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of background or identity. This code applies to all spaces managed by the OmniCloud project, including but not limited to codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms, mailing lists, events, and any other forums created by the project team. It also applies when an individual is representing the community in public spaces.

The OmniCloud community is committed to providing a safe environment for all participants, especially those from marginalized or underrepresented groups who may face additional challenges or barriers to participation.

## Reporting Process

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns about conduct within the OmniCloud community, please report it by opening an issue on our repository with the "community-conduct" label. To protect privacy, you may also direct message any active project contributor who has been involved with the project for at least 3 months.

In your report, please include:
* Names (real, usernames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
* Description of the behavior
* Date, time, and context of the incident
* Any additional information that may be helpful

Reports will be reviewed by project contributors who have been active for at least 3 months. All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality to the extent possible in a distributed community.

### Response Process

After receiving a report, the responding community members will:

1. Review the incident report as soon as possible
2. Follow up with the reporter to get additional details if needed
3. Consult with at least two other long-term contributors to determine appropriate action
4. Communicate with the individual(s) involved in the incident
5. Take appropriate action based on community consensus
6. Follow up with the reporter to ensure the issue has been addressed

We are committed to a fair process for all parties involved. Due to our decentralized structure, response times may vary, but all reports will be taken seriously.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

In our distributed community model, enforcement is a shared responsibility. The most active and established contributors in the community are expected to help uphold our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful behavior.

Active contributors have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Contributors making moderation decisions should communicate their reasoning when appropriate and strive for transparency while respecting privacy concerns.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Conflict Resolution Process

We believe that most disagreements and conflicts can be resolved amicably through open communication. When conflicts arise:

1. **Direct Communication**: We encourage individuals to address issues directly with each other when possible, using private channels and respectful language.

2. **Mediation**: If direct communication doesn't resolve the issue, either party can request a mediator from the project team who will help facilitate a conversation.

3. **Project Team Intervention**: If the issue remains unresolved, the project team will review the situation and make a decision based on this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including but not limited to:

* All repositories and project spaces related to OmniCloud
* Project meetings and events, both online and offline
* Community forums and mailing lists
* Social media communications when representing the project
* Conference presentations and speaking engagements related to the project
* One-on-one communications conducted in the context of community business

This Code also applies when an individual is officially representing the OmniCloud community in public spaces.

## Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the project team with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governance policies.

## Continuous Improvement

This Code of Conduct is a living document and may be amended in the future as our community evolves. We welcome feedback and suggestions for improvement from community members.

## Special Considerations for OmniCloud Sub-Projects

All sub-projects of OmniCloud are expected to adopt and adhere to this Code of Conduct. Sub-project maintainers may extend this Code of Conduct with additional guidelines specific to their project context, but such extensions must be consistent with the principles outlined here and cannot remove or weaken any of the protections established in this document.

## Safe and Inclusive Technical Practices

As an infrastructure project, OmniCloud is committed to safe and inclusive technical practices. This includes:

* Writing inclusive documentation that avoids unnecessary jargon and explains concepts clearly
* Using inclusive language in code, comments, and technical discussions
* Designing systems that respect user privacy and security
* Considering accessibility in all aspects of our project
* Being mindful of potential biases in algorithms and data processing

## Training and Education

The OmniCloud project is committed to providing resources and guidance to help community members understand and uphold this Code of Conduct. We will:

* Provide clear documentation about community expectations
* Offer resources for learning about inclusive practices
* Support mentorship initiatives to help newcomers navigate community norms
* Regularly discuss and reinforce these values in community spaces

## Decentralized Enforcement

Because OmniCloud operates with a distributed governance model rather than centralized management, enforcement of this Code of Conduct relies on the collective responsibility of the community. This means:

1. All active contributors are responsible for addressing violations they witness
2. Repository maintainers are expected to moderate their own repositories
3. Decisions about serious violations should involve at least 3 established contributors
4. Public discussions about enforcement should focus on the behavior, not individuals
5. The community operates on consensus when possible for major decisions
